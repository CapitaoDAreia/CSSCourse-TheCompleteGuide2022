# Position Notes

## Static
- The STATIC position is the default position attribute element.

## Fixed
- The FIXED position puts the element in relationship with the viewport.


## Absolute
- The ABSOLUTE position, unless the parent have a position defined, puts the element
in relationship with the viewport too.

## Relative
- The RELATIVE position puts the element in a relationship with himself. LOL


## Sticky
- The STICKY position make the element roll down while you scroll the page. 



### Think that you only see any position working(excluding STATIC) with the Top, Rigth, Left and Bottom properties declared.
