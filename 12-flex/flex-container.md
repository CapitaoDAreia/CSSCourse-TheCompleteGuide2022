# Flex Container

## Main Axis and Cross Axis

### First thing we have to know is:
-  The Main Axis, in the defalut value, beggins at the top-left corner of the box, and the Cross Axis beggins in the top-left too. Nonetheless, the Main Axis goes to the right direction, while the Cross Axis goes to the bottom.
<br>
- We can change that behavior using the property <strong>flex-direction</strong>.
<br>
<br>

### Second thing we have to know is:
- It is possible to work for align all the elements we have under the flex behavior with the property <strong>align-items</strong>.<br> This property always refers to the Cross Axis.
<br>
- About the Main Axis, it is possible to work for play around with his position too. Using the <strong>justify-content</strong> property we can adjust the elements along the Main AXIS.
<br>
- There is other property that can emerge into both previous, is the <strong>align-content</strong> property. In a shorthand, this property refers to the Cross Axis and sets the distribution of space between and around content items.
