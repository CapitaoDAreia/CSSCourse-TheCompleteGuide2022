# Advanced Selector

- .class-name input[type="checkbox"]{

}
<br>
This is a way to use a selector that hits all input elements with a specific class that have a checkbox type.
<br>
- .class-name input[id*="any"]{

}
<br>
This is another interesting approach in advanced selectors. In this case, every id element with a specific <br> class name that have the term "any" in your id name will carry the rules.
